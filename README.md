```GDScript
# Multiple Async or Signal or Coroutine can be combined into a new Async
var all_async := Async.all([
    Async.from(_coro), # from Async
    obj.signal,        # from Signal
    func(): return 0   # from Coroutine
])
var result = await all_async.wait()

# or you can await it immediately.
var result = await Async.wait_all([
    Async.from(_coro),
    obj.signal,
    func(): return 0
])

# Includes general patterns for await
Async.all()
Async.all_settled()
Async.any()
Async.race()
Async.wait_all()
Async.wait_all_settled()
Async.wait_any()
Async.wait_race()

# and support continuations and cancellations.
var another_async = async.then(func(prev_result):
    return prev_result * prev_result)
var cancel := Cancel.new()
await another_async.wait(cancel)
```

# Nesinkrona (for Godot 4 Î²1, 2)

An addon to enhance the awaitability of GDScript 2.0.

<br />

* It improves the readability and naturalness of code that is intermingled with signals and coroutines. (similar to Promise in JS or Task in C#).
* Fast due to simple implementation.
* Can be canceled from outside of await.
* Contains patterns that reproduce iterations with yield. (experimental)
